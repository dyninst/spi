Install
-------
1. Copy example-make.config to be "config.mk".
2. Edit make.config to define each macro variable.
  - DYNINST_DIR: absolute path of Dyninst, which contains directories like
    dyninstAPI, parseAPI, ...
  - SP_DIR: absolute path of this package (the output of `pwd`), because this
    file is also used by Makefile, I don't put `pwd` in it.
  - DYNLINK: true for building shared library for agent, otherwise for building
    static library
