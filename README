Note
----
1. Currently SPI depends on a customized dyninstAPI
  - build dyninst with arch-x86.h exposed to public
  - build dyninst with OpenMP disabled

-------
Install
-------
1. Copy example-make.config to be "config.mk".
2. Edit make.config to define each macro variable.
  - DYNINST_DIR: absolute path of Dyninst, which contains directories like
    dyninstAPI, parseAPI, ...
  - SP_DIR: absolute path of this package (the output of `pwd`), because this
    file is also used by Makefile, I don't put `pwd` in it.
  - DYNLINK: true for building shared library for agent, otherwise for building
    static library

---------------------
Environment variables
---------------------
1. FOR DEBUGGING
1.1. SP_COREDUMP: enables core dump when segfault happens
1.2. SP_DEBUG: enables printing out debugging messages
1.3. SP_TEST_RELOCINSN: only uses instruction relocation instrumentation worker
1.4, SP_TEST_RELOCBLK: only uses call block relocation instrumentation worker
1.5, SP_TEST_SPRING: only uses sprint block instrumentation worker
1.6, SP_TEST_TRAP: only uses trap instrumentation worker
1.7, SP_NO_TAILCALL: don't instrument tail calls
1.8, SP_LIBC_MALLOC: will always use libc malloc
1.9, SP_NO_LIBC_MALLOC: will never use libc malloc

2. FOR RUNTIME
PLATFORM: 'i386-unknown-linux2.4' for x86 or 'x86_64-unknown-linux2.4' for
          x86-64
SP_DIR: the root directory of self-propelled instrumentation.
SP_AGENT_DIR: the directory path of agent shared library that will be injected.

---------------------
Shared memory id used
---------------------
1. 1986+[user_process_pid]: for communication between injector process and user process

Make arguments
--------------
- For testing
  - make unittest: build unittests
  - make mutatee: build simple mutatees
  - make external_mutatee: build real world mutatees
  - make test: unittest + mutatee + external_mutatee

- For main self propelled
  - make injector_exe
  - make agent_lib
  - make spi: agent_lib + injector_exe

- For everything
  - make / make all: spi + test

- For cleaning
  - make clean_test: clean test stuffs
  - make clean: only clean core self-propelled stuffs, excluding dependency
  - make clean_all: clean everything, including dependency
  - make clean_objs: clean core self-propelled objs

---
SSH
---
- To run test suite:
  - make "ssh localhost" work without typing in password

-----
TODOS
-----
- Inter-host propel
- Solve the arch-x86.h dependency problem
  - A possible solution is to expose codegenAPI in dyninst
- OpenMP hangs during parsing
- Test suite
